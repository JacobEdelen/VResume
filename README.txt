Hello!  This is my VR Resume.
This was designed using an HTC Vive in UE 4.24

A couple of things you should know:

Play - touch middle play button with hand

Grab - Grip buttons

At first the experience will be dark.  This is part of the experience.  It's meant to
give you time to set up in the middle of your play space.

If you have any questions, please reach out at contact@jacobedelen.com

Enjoy!
